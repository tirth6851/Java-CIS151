# Lab 4: Reverse Number Analysis

This lab focuses on reverse looping, condition checking, and summation.  
The goal is to build confidence in controlling loop direction, filtering values, and accumulating totals.

---

## Objective

Ask the user for a positive integer **N**, then:

1. Print numbers from N down to 1.
2. Print only the numbers in that range that are multiples of 3.
3. Print the sum of all values from N down to 1.
4. Display an error and exit if N < 1.

---

## Example Output

Enter N: 10

Reverse: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Multiples of 3: 9 6 3
Sum = 55
