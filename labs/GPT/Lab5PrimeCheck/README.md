# Lab 5: Prime Number Analyzer

This lab focuses on using loops to determine mathematical properties of a number.
The goal is to identify all the factors of a number and evaluate whether the number is prime.

---

## Objective

Ask the user for a positive integer N, then:

1. Print all factors of N.
2. Count the total number of factors.
3. If the number has exactly 2 factors → it is Prime.
4. Otherwise → Not Prime.
5. If N < 1, show an error.

## Example Output

Enter N: 122  
Factors: 1  3 4 6 12  
Total Factors: 6  
Not Prime

Enter N: 7  
Factors: 1 7  
Total Factors: 2  
Prime
