# Lab Exercises - AI-Assisted Learning

## Overview
This folder contains Java loop exercises created as part of the CIS 151 coursework. These labs demonstrate the use of AI tools (ChatGPT) as a learning aid while maintaining hands-on coding practice.

## Development Approach
These exercises were developed using a collaborative learning methodology:
- **AI Assistance**: Used ChatGPT to generate exercise ideas and explanations
- **Personal Implementation**: Wrote all final code personally
- **Testing & Validation**: Independently tested logic and verified outputs
- **Repository Structure**: Built and organized the repository structure

## Lab Exercises

### Lab 2: Pattern Printing
**Folder**: `Lab2Pattern/`
- Practice with nested loops
- Console output formatting
- Pattern generation algorithms

### Lab 3: Even/Odd Checker
**Folder**: `Lab3EvenOdd/`
- User input handling
- Conditional logic
- Modulo operator usage

### Lab 4: String Reversal
**Folder**: `Lab4Reverse/`
- String manipulation
- Character array operations
- Reverse algorithms

### Loop Counting and Summation
**Folder**: `LoopCountingAndSum/`
- Accumulator patterns
- Loop control structures
- Mathematical computations

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding loop structures (for, while)
- Practicing nested loop patterns
- Implementing common algorithms
- Working with user input and output
- Problem-solving with iterative approaches

## Usage
Each subfolder contains:
- Java source files (.java)
- Compiled class files (.class) where applicable
- Individual exercise implementations

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Variables, loops, conditionals
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down problems into steps
- **AI-Assisted Learning**: Using modern tools effectively
- **Code Organization**: Structuring projects logically
- **Testing**: Validating program behavior

## Notes on AI Collaboration
While AI tools like ChatGPT were used for:
- Generating exercise concepts
- Providing explanations of programming concepts
- Offering suggestions for code structure

All final implementations represent personal work:
- Code was written and understood independently
- Logic was tested and debugged personally
- Solutions demonstrate genuine understanding
