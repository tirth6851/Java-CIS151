# Stats Utils

## Objective
Practice user-defined methods by building a small stats utility for integer datasets.

## Requirements
- Implement methods: sum, average, printReport
- main should only create the dataset and call printReport
- No printing inside sum/average
- Handle empty array case

## Expected Output (for {12, 8, 15, 4, 20})
Count: 5
Sum: 59
Average: 11.8

## Expected Output (for empty array)
Count: 0
Sum: 0
Average: N/A
