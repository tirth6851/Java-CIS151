# Lab 2: Pattern Triangle

This lab teaches how to use nested loops to print simple patterns in Java.  
The goal is to understand how an outer loop controls rows and an inner loop controls the number of characters printed per row.

## Objective
Ask the user for a positive integer **N** and print a left-aligned triangle like this:

*

2. Use an inner loop for printing stars.
3. Print a new line after each row.
4. Show an error message if N < 1.
