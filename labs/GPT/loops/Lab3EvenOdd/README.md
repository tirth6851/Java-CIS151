# Lab 3: Even–Odd Separator

This lab focuses on using loop logic together with conditional statements.  
The goal is to analyze each number in a range and decide whether it is even or odd while using only a single loop.

---

## Objective
Ask the user for a positive integer **N**.  
Your program must:

1. Print all numbers from 1 to N on one line.
2. Print all even numbers from that same range.
3. Print all odd numbers from that same range.
4. Use **ONE loop only** to process all numbers.
5. Display an error message if N < 1.

## Example Output
Enter N: 6

All: 1 2 3 4 5 6
Even: 2 4 6
Odd: 1 3 5
