# Lab 6: Multiplication Table & Sum Checker

This lab continues skill-building with loops.  
The goal is to generate a multiplication table and analyze the total of its products.

---

## Objective

Ask the user for a positive integer N, then:

1. Print a formatted multiplication table from 1 through N.
2. Each line must follow the format: `i x j = product`.
3. While printing, calculate the running sum of all products.
4. After the table completes, print:
   - The total sum
   - Whether the sum is EVEN or ODD
5. If N < 1, show an error.

## Example Output

Enter N: 5  
1 x 1 = 1  
1 x 2 = 2  
1 x 3 = 3  
...  
5 x 5 = 25  
Sum: 155  
ODD

Enter N: 3  
1 x 1 = 1  
1 x 2 = 2  
1 x 3 = 3  
2 x 1 = 2  
2 x 2 = 4  
2 x 3 = 6  
3 x 1 = 3  
3 x 2 = 6  
3 x 3 = 9  
Sum: 36  
EVEN
