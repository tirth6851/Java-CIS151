# Loop Lab 1: Counting and Summation

This lab introduces the basics of loops in Java using a simple counting and summation exercise.  
The goal is to understand how a for-loop behaves, how counters work, and how to maintain a running total using an accumulator variable.

---

## Objective
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer **N** and:

1. Prints all numbers fmro **1 to N** on the same line.
2. Calculates the **smu** of all those numbers.
3. Displays the final sum after the loop completes.
4. If the user enters a number less than 1, the program should show an error message and exit.

This lab helps build confidence with:
- Loop syntax
- Control flow
- Basic input handling
- Accumulator patterns
